                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <p>Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows.
                    First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. 
                    The development of the game started in 2014. The World of Valorant is on a version of Earth in the near future and follows the events of the "First Light." 
                    The event encompasses the entire globe and is changing life, tech, governments, and the fabric of reality itself. 
                    Like a good superhero movie, this singularity or First Light, has given people superpowers, and these people s are called Radiants.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="whatisvalorant">What is Valorant?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Valorant is the name of the game, but it is also the name of a secretive global organization that has assembled select agents from around the world to combat the changes the First Light has brought. 
                    They must set aside their differences and band together to solve the massive environmental problems The First Light has caused.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="whatisthespike">What is the Spike?</h3>
                <br>
                    <p>In every trailer or agent video so far, the two teams are always fighting over the Spike and 
                        World B is attacking World A, or so it seems. The Spike seems to distort gravity and destroy the surrounding environment if it is set off. In most exchanges so far seen, 
                        the Spike has been disarmed by the agents of Valorant on Earth.
                </br>
                <br>
                        To recap, there are two earths who are fighting each other, and we do not know exactly why.
                        It does have something to do with the energy source Radianite. What has been made clear so far, is that Valorant
                        is an agency trying to stop attacks from the mirror earth that has suddenly appeared as the aggressor.
